# Portfolio Web

Simple portfolio website for showing my past projects. It utilizes React + Vite to create smoooth and sleek design. 

Originally designed by [Codin Zero](https://github.com/c0d1nn) modified by me.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# How to Run

Run this command on terminal

```
npm install
```
then start Vite by running

```
npm run dev
```
